## Smark Car Parking System & Billing Framework

## Project Description
TThe intelligent car parking system is designed to streamline the process of parking management in 
urban areas. It uses logic gates and sensors to automate the detection of parked vehicles, display 
available spots, and generate automatic billing based on the duration of the stay. The system 
provides a real-time update of parking status using LED indicators and a seven-segment display, 
ensuring a seamless parking experience for drivers.
